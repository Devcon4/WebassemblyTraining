# Primer on WebAssembly
---

Have you ever run into a problem and knew about the perfect library to fix it, but you can't use it on the web because it's not Javascript? This is one of the big problems WebAssembly can solve.

## introduction
So what even is WebAssembly, and how does it work? Well lets start with a definition from webassembly.org.

> WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

In laymans terms WebAssembly is a low level language that browsers can run. Lets look at an example add function.

```
(module
    (func $multiply (param $p1 i32) (param $p2 i32) (result i32)
        local.get $p1
        local.get $p2
        i32.add)
    (export "add" (func $add))    
    )

```

Wasm normally compiles to a binary format so you never see this, but for debug/example purposes it has a text format called wat. It also looks way different from other languages because it is a Stack Based language.

## Compiling

So cool WebAssembly is another language on the web, but how do you actually use it? First is to pick a language. Rust has great support for compiling to Wasm. There is also [AssemblyScript](assemblyscript.org) which turns a subset of TypeScript into WebAssembly. I am more familiar with c++ than rust (not by much) so i'll use it as an example.

There is a great tool called [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/index.html). Emscripten can compile c/c++ code into .wasm and asm.js code. What is asm.js? It is a stripped down subset of Javascript that is faster. Sometimes you have WebAssembly code (a rust library) that you need to run on an older browser, so you can convert back to javascript.

When we move code to run in the browser one thing to keep in mind is we don't have common things like a File System, and vice-versa you have things like DOM that don't exist in c++. Emscripten solves most of those problems for you by porting the standard language libraries for c/c++ along with stuff like OpenGL to WebGL.

[Entry.cpp](./src/cpp/Entry.cpp) is an example of how to expose c++ for use from Javascript.

I don't want to get too far into the weeds of compiling c++ code. Take a look at the repo if you want to see more details.

## Frontend

So now that we have some wasm how do we use it from Javascript? This is the part I had the most issues with (still can't figure it out ðŸ˜¢). The first part that we have to do is register our WebAssembly file as a module. We also have to setup Imports now. Doing this in normal Javascript is fairly straight forward.

``` Javascript
    // Javascript
    const imports = {
        log: str => Console.log(str),
        env: {
            memory: new WebAssembly.Memory({initial: 1}),
            STACKTOP: 0,
        }
    };

    // Important section.
    const {instance} = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch('/a.out.wasm'), imports);

    instance.exports.add(1, 2);
```
We call `WebAssembly.instatiateStreaming` and pass in a fetch promise of our wasm file and an imports object, Pretty straight forward. Now that imports object has a special `env` object on it. Our wasm code really has no idea about the real world, one thing we have to do it give it some memory it can use. Another cool thing we can do with this imports object is to expose Javascript functions to our wasm code. Let's look at the c that is getting generated.

``` c
    #include "emscripten.h"

    EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE
    void log(char* str);

    EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE
    void add(int a, int b) {
        log("Adding!");
        return a + b;
    }
```

Again nothing crazy (except it's c...) We declare two function, add and log. We need the `EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE` attributes so that when this c code is compiled it isn't removed for not being called in c. The log function doesn't have a body, The import object from javascript is providing that for us.

So from Javascript we just called a c function compiled to wasm that called back to Javascript that logged to the console, Cool.

## Conclusion

This is a very brief fly over on WebAssembly but I hope it is starting to click how you can use it in different situations to get performance bumps or to use a library you normally wouldn't be able too. The tooling around bundling wasm is not that awesome yet, i'm still trying to figure out that part.
